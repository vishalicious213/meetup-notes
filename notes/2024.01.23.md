# DevTalk LA: LangChain

## Details

This week's topic: LangChain

As described in Thoughtworks Technology Radar Vol. #28.

LangChain is a framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). These models have triggered a race to incorporate generative AI in several use cases. However, using these LLMs in isolation may not be enough â€” you have to combine them with your differentiated assets to build an impactful product. LangChain fills this niche with some neat features, including prompt management, chaining, data augmented generation and a rich set of agents to determine which actions to take and in what order. We expect more tooling and frameworks to evolve with LLMs, and we recommend assessing LangChain.
